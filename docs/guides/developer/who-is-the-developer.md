# Who is the developer?

In the context of this guide, the developer is someone who:
- is looking to expand the build system to add more options, expand the project
  dependencies
- a project developer who is looking at implementing this template project
- a CMake enthusiast looking for a common standard for their design. (Feel free
  to interact in the template [issue page] if you have any comments)
- a non-CMake build-system enthusiast. There is no discrimination here :)
